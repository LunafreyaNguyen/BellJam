Cecilia: What a relief.
Cecilia: Thought I'd have to spend another day wiping the blood off my blade, heh...

Cecilia: Didn't know it was already Christmas, heh.
Victoria: OHOHOH!
Victoria: Now that is a new one! Where did you get that one?

Victoria: As your superior, you know I can't let you go see her, right?
Cecilia: Heh, sorry! Can't help it. Guess I've always been a bit rebellious.
Victoria: Oh my, looks like HR's going to have to get involved after I'm done disciplining you.
Cecilia: Sorry Bladie, looks like I'll be cleaning you today after all!
Victoria: Now then, let us begin!
